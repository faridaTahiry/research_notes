## Preliminary Writeup

Exploration in Minecraft is a high-level operational logic. It arises out of several other logics and basic mechanics, including:

- Navigation (e.g. movement, vehicles).
- Geography/ecology (from world generation).
- Mechanics for telling location and direction, (e.g. sun position,
  compass/maps, or even the debug info).
- The map item and associated mechanics.

As an operational logic, exploration supports the following myths of
colonialism:

1. The idea that the colonized land was unoccupied prior to colonization.
2. The idea that the Indigenous peoples were not using the land, or were
   exceedingly sparse in population, and thus the arrival of the colonizers did
   not displace them or their activities.
3. The idea that Indigenous peoples were subhuman, and therefore any treatment
   at the hands of the colonizers was morally neutral.
4. The idea that Indigenous peoples had a less "advanced" civilization, and
   therefore the colonizer's actions were justified because they ultimately
   benefited the Indigenous people.

Myth 1 is mainly supported by most of the land actually being unoccupied by
villagers. But the exploration mechanics furthermore encourage the player to
move through this empty territory, and they make available things like
landmarks that the player (but never the villagers) can relate to. This also
relates to myth 2, whereby players are the only entities that explore
(villagers do not), and even the maps that can be obtained from villagers are
only partial, and can be amended by the player, implying that the villagers
merely discover ancient maps, rather than making them themselves, or at least
that villagers are inferior mappers (myth #4). Myths 3 and 4 are also supported
by the fact that of the structures within the world that imply present or past
sentience, many of which are the explicit targets of and rewards for
exploration, the villagers only inhabit villages, and they do not undertake any
activities that imply that they have the capacity to build or maintain those
other structures (in fact they don't even expand their villages themselves).
Thus villagers are portrayed as helpless and incapable of creating the ancient
ruins that surround them.

Importantly, villagers do not have their own full-resolution maps of their own
villages or surrounding territories, and the player cannot gain complete local
geographical knowledge by communicating with them (the maps they do trade for
are partial and focused on treasure-and-enemy-filled structures).

Furthermore, exploration is connected to looting, and structures like pyramids
or jungle temples contain signs of deceased inhabitants (e.g., rotting flesh in
pyramids) but no links to present cultures or peoples. The looting of these
(presumably sacred to someone at some point) sites is therefore construed as at
worst a victimless crime, and within the game is more naturally seen as the
deservÃ©d reward for exploration.

The woodland mansions and underwater sanctuaries are a more complex issue: they
are inhabited by (semi?) sentient beings, but these are mythologized as evil
and/or alien, and therefore acceptable targets for even preemptive attack.
Because maps to these structures can be traded for in villages, and because
after killing the defenders of these places unique treasures can be acquired,
these structures reinforce the explore -> exploit connection, while at the same
time portraying the players' activities as morally neutral or even good.

## Writeup Draft

Topic: Exploration

Definition:

Exploration in Minecraft is a high-level operational logic. It arises out of several other logics and basic mechanics, including:

- Navigation in the simulated physical world (which in turn arise out of
  mechanics related to basic movement, gravity, and block
  properties, but also importantly vehicles and specifically boats).
- The sense of a landscape, different ecosystems/climate zones, which arises
  from the world generation mechanics. Particularly the fact that landscape
  generation is varied enough to create landmarks is important.
- Mechanics for telling location and direction, including diegetic mechanics
  like the regular progress of the sun across the sky and the compass item (and
  compass-enabled maps), and extra-diegetic mechanics like the x/y/z
  coordinates displayed when debug info is turned on.
- The map item and associated mechanics, mainly that it plots a map of the
  surface as you travel.

As an operational logic, the mechanics that support "exploration" enable
interpretation of activities in the game like navigating between landmarks,
navigating into unexplored/unknown regions, and mapping (and possibly marking)
those regions so that they are no longer unknown. For the purposes of this
discussion, we will put aside the issue of marking (and related activities like
building outposts), and focus on map-making and related processes by which the
"unknown" becomes "known."

Exploration is an immensely satisfying experience in the real world, and
bringing into one's personal knowledge more details of the world is an activity
that we take joy in even as babies [cite?]. But personal exploration is not
strictly necessary in a world where we can communicate with others: an
alternative to exploring is asking for information, and as long as we trust the
descriptions we are given, we can obtain vast knowledge of geography from books
and atlases without travelling at all. But within the operation of colonialism,
exploration takes on a very particular character: instead of seeking to
understand the knowledge of geography that the people living in a colonized
area already possess, colonizers create their own maps, sometimes asking
natives to act as guides but never accepting their knowledge as fact. This is
in contrast to how colonial powers exchanged knowledge freely with each other,
and maps sent back from the colonies were generally accepted and used by other
colonizers as the basis for further colonial projects (despite frequent and
wild inaccuracies) [cite].

Two possible reasons for this distinction present themselves: first, that
Indigenous knowledge of geography was incompatible in form with the knowledge
of the colonizers, e.g., memorized oral recitations or even stories that
encoded geographical information as opposed to two-dimensional pictures on
paper. In many cases the colonizers likely lacked the capacity to even
comprehend Indigenous knowledge of geography in its original form, because they
did not understand the languages, they did not have the necessary personal
experience of landmarks, or they simply did not have sufficiently developed
oral memorization skills to correctly receive and retain the knowledge.

But another reason likely also contributed to the colonizers' preference for
(re)making their own maps: they did not respect the Indigenous peoples, and
either did not believe that the knowledge they wanted was available, or
intentionally avoided it because its existence contradicted the world view of
colonialism that justified their exploitative actions. Several common
justifications for colonialism are directly contradicted by the existence of
Indigenous knowledge of geography:

1. The idea that the colonized land was unoccupied prior to colonization. If
   there were no indigenous people, or at least none that claimed a particular
   territory, then it is not possible for there to have been Indigenous maps of
   the land.
2. The idea that the Indigenous peoples were not using the land, or were
   exceedingly sparse in population, and thus the arrival of the colonizers did
   not displace them or their activities. Again in this case, Indigenous
   knowledge of geography implies that the native populations had already
   explored the land, understood it, and maintained active relationships with
   it (as was actually the case).
3. The idea that Indigenous peoples were subhuman, and therefore any treatment
   at the hands of the colonizers was morally neutral. The existence of
   Indigenous maps (along with other Indigenous technologies) directly
   contradicts this idea.
4. The idea that Indigenous peoples had a less "advanced" civilization, and
   therefore the colonizer's actions were justified because they ultimately
   benefited the Indigenous people. The colonizers' mapping technology must be
   established as totally superior to Indigenous technologies to support this
   narrative, and the existence of Indigenous maps contradicts this. In
   particular, the idea that Indigenous might teach the colonizers anything
   undermines this myth.

In the end, regardless of the specific reasons that colonizers had for
disregarding Indigenous knowledge of geography and reproducing it (poorly) with
their own maps, the present-day view of colonization denies this knowledge,
which serves the purpose of helping to ameliorate modern-day opinions about
colonization via the myths detailed above. The most obvious example of this is
the idea of an "age of exploration" that is still present in contemporary
history textbooks [cite!].

To unpack the problems with this idea briefly, consider the definition of "exploration:" [cite]

...

To truly explore an area, the area must be unknown, but that fact can only be
established relative to a base of knowledge. For example, many areas of the
world are unknown to me personally, and thus I could be said to, for example
"explore Paris," even though someone who lived there could not. But when we
talk about exploration by institutions (e.g., nations), again there must be
some assumption that the institution is unaware of the area to be explored
prior to the exploration. So for example, contemporary Germany could not
"explore" contemporary France, because those institutions already have intimate
knowledge of each other. Exactly who within those institutions has access to
the knowledge and where it is kept may vary, but the institutional knowledge
exists.

So during the "age of exploration," we see European nations for the first time
acquiring knowledge (and in part specifically geographic knowledge) of the
Americas, parts of Africa, parts of India and Southeast Asia, and Australia and
various Pacific islands [cite]. This new knowledge (for these institutions) was
coincident with brutal subjugation and the beginnings of colonization
throughout these regions. So from the perspective of a few European nations,
this era really did coincide with a great deal of institutional exploration. At
the same time, from the perspective of most of the world, although contact was
established with the exploring powers and thus some institutional knowledge was gained, similar geographic knowledge was not provided by the colonizers to the Indigenous populations that they interacted with, and those populations did not effectively "explore" Europe.

When geographic knowledge was disseminated to Indigenous institutions, it more
often was communicated: the Indigenous did not create their own maps of Europe
by exploring it in person, but instead gained knowledge of Europe by talking
with Europeans, something that the Europeans refused to do themselves. Thus the
label "age of exploration" is only valid from a very narrow historical
perspective. In particular, we can contrast the events of the "age of
exploration" with the discovery and exploration of the continent of Antarctica,
where no humans had previously been. Once again, only specific institutions
actually gained geographic knowledge of Antarctica originally, but at the same
time this was not knowledge that could have been transferred from some existing
institution or group of people, but instead genuinely new knowledge in human
history. Accordingly, the exploration of Antarctica stands out from the
"discoveries" of the "age of exploration" as a different kind of event. But in
the colonial mythology, there is no such distinction. Exploration of the
Americas, Africa, India, Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific islands is
depicted as an outstanding feat of human achievement with no mention of the
alternative that such knowledge could have been gained by communication rather
than being painstakingly re-created by European explorers.



"""
Antarctica is therefore one of the few places in the world that can truly be described as having been discovered, rather than there being people already living there who had known about it for hundreds or thousands of years before its "discovery".
"""

https://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/science/can_you_live_in_antarctica.php




This idea of exploring an "unknown" world whereby the perspective of certain
European nations is universalized is an important justificatory fiction for
colonialism. It not only glorifies the explorers (while carefully omitting
their systematic abuse of Indigenous populations), but also subtly implies that
had their voyages not taken place, the various peoples that they contacted
around the world would never have come into contact, and no global geographical
knowledge (as is ubiquitous today) would ever have been assembled. By avoiding
any discussion of alternatives to the re-mapping of well-known territories and
the European unwillingness and inability to receive or comprehend Indigenous
geographical knowledge, colonialist histories conveniently sidestep questions
about the legitimacy and value of the "exploration" that took place.

The glorification of exploration and erasure of Indigenous geographical
knowledge serves today to maintain a Eurocentric historical perspective and
thus help prevent modern questioning of the legitimacy of colonial
institutions. And Minecraft has its part to play in this, as its mechanics and
operational logics support the idea of a world without Indigenous geographical
knowledge.


In fact, for much of its history before the first official 1.0 release, Minecraft did not have any mechanics interpretable as representing Indigenous inhabitants of the generated terrain, except for hostile mobs like zombies and skeletons which appeared sentient but absolutely malevolent, and which showed no behavior besides aggression towards the player. Long before villagers were added (in the Beta 1.8 release a.k.a. the "Adventure Update" on September 14, 2011).

1.0 release on November 18, 2011),
