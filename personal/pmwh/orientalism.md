# Noes on Edward Said's **Orientalism**

[Peter's notes](index.html)

## Notes

- p. 6 Don't assume that Orientalism is a myth that can be dispelled by stating
  or discovering the truth.
- p. 20 strategic location & formation.
- p. 22 the hollowness of the Orient; its independence from the actual Orient.
- p. 24 how can one study other cultures from a nonrepressive and
  nonmanipulative perspective?
- p. 26 standardization of stereotypes through media; games continue this.
- Raymond Williams ("inherent dominative mode")
- p. 27 the importance of lived experience

## Big points

- ~p. 24 There's a very deep criticism of humanistic epistemology going on
  here, which could extend to scientific epistemology as well: We like to think
  as scientists or humanists that we produce knowledge by writing down our
  ideas so that we can communicate them. But Said's work here demonstrates the
  ridiculousness of the idea of studying a subject merely by reading about it,
  and furthermore, it shows that in our position as inhabitants of a
  politicized society, and as relatively more or less dogmatic adherents to
  scholarly traditions of knowledge, our contributions to those traditions are
  inevitably just that: not knowledge, but rather the extension of a tradition,
  which is in fact also simultaneously a hegemonic cultural force and thus a
  mechanism of power/domination. This relates to the philosophical idea of
  intentionality.
    * An example: how should I teach someone about California? Instead of
      writing a book or even website about it, it's better that I take them
      there and travel with them so they can experience it themselves. In fact,
      no amount of reading, looking at pictures, watching videos, or even
      playing VR games can substitute for the actual experience of being there,
      and particularly meeting those who live there (note: and who exactly are
      we talking about?). Thus any kind of humanistic study of California can
      never authentically serve the purpose of educating people about
      California, or producing true *knowledge of* California. In fact, even as
      someone who grew up in (part of) California and has lived there the
      majority of my adult life, I have only a shallow knowledge of it.
    * But is this problem confined to humanistic inquiry? It may not be quite
      the same in the sciences, but neither it is totally absent. Some true
      knowledge of technical subjects can also be acquired mainly by
      experience, and therefore again writing and publishing is an empty
      gesture, to a degree. Knoweldge ends up being shared not by words, but by
      reenactment and rediscovery (which admittedly could be guided by words).
      Of course this highlights the importance of educational institutions
      where experience can be propagated, but those have very limited reach.
