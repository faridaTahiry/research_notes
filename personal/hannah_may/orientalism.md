[Personal Pages](index.html)

## Section 1

### Introduction
- Definitions
    * A way of coming to terms with the Orient that is based on the Orient's special place in Europe (1)
    * Deep recurring images of the other 
    * A style of thought based on the distinction between "The Orient" and "The Occident" (2)
    * A corporate institution for dealing with the Orient by making statements, teaching, settling, ruling (3)
    * A distribution of geopolitical awareness into aesthetic (12)
    * An elaborate geopolitical distinction to include interests, including landscape/sociology/psychology
- The Occident
    * Not oriental 
    * 1800's to WWII it was France/Britain, post WWII to now it is America
- Qualifications of Orientalism (4)
    * It is not an idea, there are consistent ideas about the orient
    * The ideas cannot be understood without force, power and dominance
    * The structure is rooted in politics and bleeds out to the general population
- Hegemony (7)
    * Introduced through Gramsci 
    * The idea that certain cultures rise over others, which leads to cultural leadership
    * The result of cultural hegemony gives orientalism its backbones, there are "us" the superior as opposed to "others"
    * There is hegemony of European ideas about the orient 
    * There are two kinds of society: civil and political
    * Civil society consists of voluntary things: schools, families, unions and leads to culture
    * Political society consists of state institutionss: the army, polic and central bureacracy and leads to domination 
- Pure political knowledge
    * Most knowledge is political, rare for knowledge to be simply pure 
    * Be aware that no matter what, as a part of western culture, by studying orientalism we are orientalists 
- Orientalism in the modern world 
    * Provokes artists to their vision, but rarely guides them
    * Western representations make the orient visible and clear
    * Television, film and media have forced info into a standardized mold using cultural stereotyping  

### The Scope of Orientalism

- Arthur James Balfour 
    * Spoke in 1990 to the House of Commons
    * Justifies the British occupation of Egypt through knowledge and power
    * The knowledge of things yields the ability ot dominate or have authority over something
    * Also claims that Egyptians are lucky to be occupied by a great power, it is a public service because it elevates the world community 
- Circular logic justification of British occupation of England (34)
    * England knows Egypt
    * Therefore, England knows that Egypt does not have the ability for self governance
    * England confirms this fact by occupying Egypt (that they were able to occupy Egypt "proves" this point)
    * On the opposite side of the curtain: 
    * Being occupied by England is all that Egypt knows
    * Being occupied has become a basis of human civilization in Egypt
    * Egypt therefore "insists" and requires to be occupied
    * AND England knows that Egypt feels this way because they have this "knowledge" of Egypt, so they know how they feel 
- The implications of that circular logic 
    * Egypt was only "good" or "productive" in the past, the only reason they are useful now is because England has kept them up to date
    * Therefore, the "modern" empire that is England has saved them from decline
    * Therefore, England knows better than Egypt does what it is that Egypt needs 
    * It is clear here that knowledge leads to power, to get more power, more knowledge is required 
- Cromer (38)
    * Led the English occupation of Egypt
    * Believed that all orientals were essentially the same, being that they were easy to manage
    * Knowledge on orientalists is static, they are all gullible, devoid of energy and lack logic
    * Deviation from this norm of oriental behavior is unatural 
- Two principle elements of East/West relationships since mid-18th century 
    * Knowledge, which was reinforced by an interest in the unknown with developing sciences
    * Strength, on political, cultural and religious grounds the West is strong and the East is weak
- Categorical polarization
    * The rational, virtuous, mature and normal European project an idea of the East onto the East which is what actually creates the concept of the Oriental
    * By placing the East as a place for judgement, scrutiny, study and governing, the East is put into this box labeled "Oriental"
    * The projected ideals are therefore what the West comes to know the East by
    * These categories ultimately create more polarization between the two
- Binary Opposition
    * Introduced by Kissinger
    * The World is developed by having ability to record/classify data, accuracy, post-Newtonian view of the world
    * The developing parts are pre- Newtonian
    * Post- Newtonian is the idea that the world is external to the observer (aka the world is real)
    * Pre- Newtonian is the idea that the world is internal to the observer
