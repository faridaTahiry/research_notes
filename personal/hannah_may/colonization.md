## Native North America

### The Political Economy of Radioactive Colonialism 
- Land
    * Central issue to North AM politics and econ
    * Control of land = control of resources
    * 1/3 of Western U.S. low sulphur coal, 20 % of known oil/nat gas reserves, over 1/2 uranium deposits are on reservations
        * given to Native Americans through treaties
        * Land expropriations by corporations and land withdrawals from indigenous nations was orchestrated by the federal government 
        * Allotment Act, Honestead Act, Termination Act
        * Government makes deals that undermind previously agreed upon treaties
        * Water rights are also at play, especially in the arid West
- Internal Colonialism
    * The colonization of indigenous people is a fact of life in US/Canada
    * Native American nations in North America today have only 2.5% of original land base
    * Indian Reorganization Act
        * 1934
        * US imposes a system of tribal council governments on each reservation
        * Designed to replace traditional/ resistant Indian government with new governments that are allegiant to Washington DC
        * Now the reservations have to go through the BIA (Bureau of Indian Affair) which is run by leaders who the traditional governments did not like
        * However, now the US government can say that the BIA is run by "Indians" themselves 
        * The fed gov immediately started undercutting their economy by reducing stock because of "overgrazing"
        * Leads to dependency : instituted "educational" systems (labor skills for industrialism), housing programs (work force concentrations), unemployment, welfare 
    * Welfare exists as a "form of pacification", keeping people alive and happy enough not to revolt but keeps them as "captive consumers" of capitalism, it dictates a corporate profit
    * 1980s/1990s Bush/Reagan econ cutbacks default to reservations
        * The reservations have to turn to corporations to "negotiate" over land/ extraction of resources
    * North American Native American populations experience the HIGHEST:
        * Rate of infant mortality
        * Incidence of malnutrition
        * Death by exposure
        * Unemployment
        * Plague/communicable disease
    * They experience the LOWEST:
        * Life expectancy
        * Level of formal education
- The New Colonialism 
    * Training programs by corporations to train Native Americans in "practical" skills
    * Radioactive Colonization
        * "Gunnery Range" in the NW quadrant of the PineRidge Reservation "borrowed" from Oglala Lakotas and the military may have used it for radioactive waste dump site 
        * Leads to leaching into local groundwater - damage is permanent
- Radioactive Colonialism
    * Energy corporations and government use local Native American work forces and pay them low wages, do not commit to community safety, do not pay severance taxes and pay minimum loyalites
    * To fix this in the short term, Native Americans can join unions, but does not actually solve any of the problems 
    * These jobs KILL
    * Short term benefits include big pay, big time employer, but leaves people in a more destitute position and a TERRIBLE environmental position
    * The only people who benefit are the corporate/government representatives of Native American populations
