## Dynamics/Operational Logics

- Renewable/non-renewable resources
- Item value & rarity
- Collection/accumulation
- Reshaping the world
- Marking the world
- Water
- 3D terrain
- Climates/ecosystems
- Day/night cycle
- Architecture + aesthetics
- Crafting requires no skill, usually no time, and almost no equipment.
- Innate abilities cannot be improved.
- [META] Death does not reset anything.
- Exploration

## Interest Areas

- Hannah: Mobs
- Ohana: Collection/accumulation and reshaping
- Christine: Advancements
- Peter: Mapping/exploration

## TODO

- Write 1--3 paragraph summaries of your interest area's relationship to
  colonialism by Thursday at 1:00 p.m.

## Followup

2019-7-11

Hannah:

- Mobs, aggro, and AI
    - Us/them mindset
    - Power imbalance
    - Imaginative geography
        * No way to claim land
        * Emotional attachment to things you build
        * Creepers

Ohana:

- Why collect if the upgrade loop is short?
- Place things in the world in a way you recognize even if the game doesn't.
- Access to infinite resources not because they're renewable but because the
  world is infinite.
- No concept of world belonging to anyone but players.
    * This is complicated because we don't want to assume land is always owned.
- Emotionally there's a sense of claiming stuff in Minecraft
- Things like chests lead to claiming territory
    * Playing "as intended" leads to claiming territory 
    * There's no push-back
    * You collect resources from other places too
- Amount of hours spent is far in excess of complexity of tech tree/campaign
- You're really the only one that moves blocks around significantly.

Christine:

- Categorized achievements
- Killing things
- Exploration
- Crafting
- Animal interactions (?)
    * Ones that involve killing and ones that don't?
- Acquisition of goods/collection
- Miscellaneous
- Actions (eat/wear/spawn/dye/play music/wear)
- Xbox has numerical values (% numeric / % value):
    * Killing -> 14% / 15%
    * Exploration -> 9% / 10%
    * Crafting -> 17% / 13%
    * Animal interactions -> 15% / 13%
    * Acquisition -> 7% / 8%
    * Actions -> 24% / 22%
