It's an interesting read in itself as well, and it echoes a lot of the points that Said makes in *Orientalism*.
    * *Concerning the League : the Iroquois League tradition as dictated in
      Onondaga by John Arthur Gibson* - A translation of the founding document
      of the Iroquois Confederacy, which the Clapp library has a copy of at:
      PM2076.C66 1992
    * *The State of Native America: genocide, colonization, and resistance* - A
      collection of essays mostly by Native Americans, this seems like a good
      place to start. It's in the library at: E93.S77 1992
          - Page 241 "Native North America: The Political Economy of
            Radioactive Colonialism" is one good chapter to read from this.
    * *Fantasies of the Master Race* - Another essay collection but this time
      about portrayals of Native Americans in literature and film, so relevant
      to our work in some way. It's at: E98.E85 C48 1992
    * *America in 1492: the world of the Indian peoples before the arrival of
      Columbus* - Another edited volume on pre-contact history, but has one
      section on colonization and apparently another on Native knowledge
      systems. It's at: E58.A526 1992

### On Colonialism in Games

* [Pleasure of Exploration and Colonial Mastery in Civilization III Play the World](pdfs/pleasure_of_exploration.pdf) - 2003 article on colonialism in Civ III that covers a lot of the same ground we propose to explore in terms of analysis, but without such direct reference to mechanics or any technical component.

* [Postcolonial Playgrounds: Games as postcolonial cultures](http://www.eludamos.org/index.php/eludamos/article/view/vol4no1-1/145) - Argues that Civ-style games don't exactly reproduce colonial mapping practices. Peter thinks this is a bit too optimistic, but it does point to an important possibility: that games and especially subversive play can in some cases reconfigure some aspects of the colonialist dominant narrative.
