#### Excuses for Colonialism

- Denial--It didn't happen.
- Distraction--Discussing colonization is too dangerous/harmful.
- Delegitimization--Only the colonizer's narrative is valid.
- Diffusion--No specific person can be blamed.
- Deflection--Some other group is the real culprit.
   * Expiration--The culprits lived long ago.
   * Projection--The enemies of the colonizers are actually to blame.
   * Fragmentation--The blame is shared by several groups.
- Historicization--It happened long ago, and is no longer relevant.
- Mythologization--Colonization is inevitable.
   * Victim-blaming--The colonized brought colonization upon themselves.
- Condemnation--The colonized deserved it.
   * Vilification--The colonized were worse than the colonizers.
   * Conflation--Both sides were colonizers.
   * Counter-Accusation--Both sides were to blame for the events.
- Justification--It was not actually bad.
   * Inversion--It was good actually.
   * Minimization--It wasn't that bad.
   * Valorization--The benefits outweigh the harm.

Specific excuses:

- Bering Land Bridge Theory: Native Americans are also (recent) settlers.
- "Savage" and "Barbarian" tropes: a mix of vilification, conflation, and
  counter-accusation, which also usually includes valorization/inversion and/or
  victim-blaming.
