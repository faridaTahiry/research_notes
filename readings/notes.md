#### Excuses for Colonialism

- Denial--It didn't happen.
- Distraction--Discussing colonization is too dangerous/harmful.
- Delegitimization--Only the colonizer's narrative is valid.
- Diffusion--No specific person can be blamed.
- Deflection--Some other group is the real culprit.
   * Expiration--The culprits lived long ago.
   * Projection--The enemies of the colonizers are actually to blame.
   * Fragmentation--The blame is shared by several groups.
- Historicization--It happened long ago, and is no longer relevant.
- Mythologization--Colonization is inevitable.
   * Victim-blaming--The colonized brought colonization upon themselves.
- Condemnation--The colonized deserved it.
   * Vilification--The colonized were worse than the colonizers.
   * Conflation--Both sides were colonizers.
   * Counter-Accusation--Both sides were to blame for the events.
- Justification--It was not actually bad.
   * Inversion--It was good actually.
   * Minimization--It wasn't that bad.
   * Valorization--The benefits outweigh the harm.

Specific excuses:

- Bering Land Bridge Theory: Native Americans are also (recent) settlers.
- "Savage" and "Barbarian" tropes: a mix of vilification, conflation, and
  counter-accusation, which also usually includes valorization/inversion and/or
  victim-blaming.
- TODO: More here

### Hannah's Notes

#### List of Pro-Colonialist justifications found in various sources

1. Why shouldn't the West colonize? From the time of the late Rennaissance to present-day, Europe has made extraordinary advances in fields of science, mathematics, literature, etc. If they can get to the Orient and they can take over with little resistance, why shouldn't they engange in this academic pursuit and advance the knowledge about mankind and the universe?

Found from page 8 of "Orientalism Now"). 

2. Countries all aorund the world have participated in colonization, not just European countries.
3. The colonized countries had a say, the goal was not to plunder/pillage the colonized countries, but rather to enrich the states were being colonized.

Found in the article ["Colonialism : Myths and Realities" by Brandon Christensen"](https://notesonliberty.com/2012/03/11/colonialism-myths-and-realities/)

Also supported in the article ["The Truth About Western 'Colonialism'"](https://www.hoover.org/research/truth-about-western-colonialism)

4. Colonialism reaffirms the primacy of human lives, universal values and shared responsibilites. 
5. There is a mission to civilize, there is a moral obligation to improve the conditions for third world countries. 
6. Colonialism is simply part of effective governance and international order. 
7. Must prioritize - in a brutally patriarchal society, access to justice for women may be more important than the protection of indigenous land rights. 
8. The level of colonial violence must be measured against violence that would have occured without colonialism and the level of violence relative to the population
9. An objective costs/benefits analysis must be performed, colonialism is defensible in places where it resulted in significant social, economic, and political gains.

Found in the article ["The Case for Colonialism" by Bruce Gilley](https://www.nas.org/academic-questions/31/2/the_case_for_colonialism)

Fun fact: this article led to such discourse in the scholarly community that the editor of the journal it was published in received death threats, the article was promptly withdrawn. 

One critic wrote that the article was the "the academic equivalent of a Trump tweet, clickbait with footnotes."

In response, Sahar Khan wrote ["The Case Against 'The Case for Colonialism'](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/case-against-case-colonialism)

Kahn debunks the entire article, I highly reccomend checking it out.

[“The case of colonialism” by Bruce Gilley (later withdrawn)] (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01436597.2017.1369037)

1. The countries that embraced their colonial inheritance, by and large, did better than those that spurned it.
2. The case for Western colonialism is about rethinking the past as well as improving the future. It involves reaffirming the primacy of human lives, universal values, and shared responsibilities – the civilising mission without scare quotes – that led to improvements in living conditions for most Third World peoples during most episodes of Western colonialism.

[“Colonialism” published in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/)
3. Whereas the Crusades were initially framed as defensive wars to reclaim Christian lands that had been conquered by non-Christians, the resulting theoretical innovations played an important role in subsequent attempts to justify the conquest of the Americas.
4. The idea that civilization is the culmination of a process of historical development, however, proved useful in justifying imperialism.
5. According to the stadial theory of historical development, all societies naturally moved from hunting, to herding, to farming, to commerce, a developmental process that simultaneously tracked a cultural arc from “savagery,” through “barbarism,” to “civilization.” “Civilization” was not just a marker of material improvement, but also a normative judgment about the moral progress of society. (Kohn and O’Neill 2006)
6. Given the tension between the abstract universalism of natural law and the actual cultural practices of indigenous peoples, it was easy to interpret native difference as evidence of the violation of natural law. This in turn became a justification for exploitation.

7. As the nations of Western Europe began to colonize the Americas, they created a discourse to justify the activity developed from legal codes of the same classical past that provided the fiction model for the activity...It also defined what constitutes civilization itself (settled agriculture and cities: tilting the earth, building walls and towers on it) as opposed to its opposite, savagery (dispersed domadism: hunting and gathering in forests).
