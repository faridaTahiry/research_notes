## Colonialism

More than just a specific historical event or process, colonialism is also a mentality which supports that process, and which is actually necessary for the continuation of that process.
In *Orientalism*, Said describes how the colonialist world-view at once exoticizes and dominates its subject:

> TODO
> TODO

As Fanon states in *The Wretched of the Earth*, "" [@fanon1959wretched, p. TODO].
Accordingly, maintaining popular support for colonialism is an indefinite necessity in societies like the United States, where the territory and 'natural resources' that enable the society to maintain its current state were ultimately taken at gunpoint from the original inhabitants.
Part of the strategy is to simply historicize those events: state that they happened in the past and deny ongoing aspects of colonialist domination, thereby insulating the present state from blame [@TODO].

Complementing this strategy is distortion of the past, both blatant (such as making Columbus out to be a hero and erecting statues and celebrating holidays in his honor) and subtle (such as portraying national parks as 'pristine wilderness' without ever mentioning original Indigenous stewardship of those lands or how they came to be uninhabited today).
Especially these subtle distortions of the past further erode any impetus for members of the society to express guilt or really consider whether the current situation is just [@TODO].
"It happened so long ago," "Wasn't it ultimately beneficial?" and "There was terrible violence on both sides," are all justifications that singly or in combination defuse any criticism of present policies or states of affairs.
And these are particularly deployed to answer the natural curiosity of children, who might otherwise grow up uneasy with the society into which they are born [@TODO].

Specific colonialist myths include ideas such as:

- Scientific racism in many forms:
    * Indigenous people as sub-human and morally equivalent to animals.
    * Indigenous people as inherently violent, irrational, or unintelligent and
      therefore in need of supervision, guidance, or 'protection from
      themselves.'
    * Indigenous people as inherently *evil*, thereby justifying attacks
      against them as preemptive self-defense.
- Religious absolutism:
    * Because Indigneous peoples do not share the dominant religion of the
      colonizers (usually Christianity) they have no moral standing.
    * Even if they do have moral standing, the benefits of converting them to
      the colonizer's religion outweigh any suffering or cultural destruction
      they may endure.
- Minimizations of colonialism:
    * The idea that Indigenous populations simply did not exist.
    * Related, the idea that Indigenous populations were sparse, and therefore
      colonialism did not significantly displace them.
    * The idea that Indigenous populations did not make use of or relate to the
      land, and therefore its use by colonizers was irrelevant to them.
    * The idea that colonization was consensual, and of course, the practices
      of manufacturing that consent through duress, corruption, or outright
      fabrication.
    * The idea that colonization was not systemic or intentional, but instead
      an unrelated sequence of trivializeable mistakes or oversights, or
      perhaps independent actions of individual evil (but now dead) people.
- Equivocations:
    * The idea the Indigenous people were also colonists, and/or that
      colonization is natural or inevitable.
    * The idea that colonialism was not violent, or at least no different from
      conflicts that existed pre-colonization.
- Capitalism-related:
    * Virtue is determined by value which is determined mainly by hoarding of
      materials, therefore Indigenous peoples are not virtuous because they do
      not engage in these activities.
    * The purchase and ownership of land, ironically both supporting schemes to
      defraud Indigenous people of their land under capitalism's rules, and in
      some cases justifying wholesale occupation of land without any
      transaction because Indigenous peoples do not claim to own it.
    * Glorification of self-sufficiency or individualism serves to obscure the
      role of institutions by blaming individuals for their failure to beat a
      system designed to deprive them.
    * The idea that acts of violence can be balanced out by reparations or
      other compensation, and relatedly that any harms of colonization have
      already been compensated for.
- Technological determinism and related circular reasoning:
    * Invalidation of Indigenous knowledge systems, or judging Indigenous
      knowledge by the standards of other knowledge systems (particularly
      science).
    * Erasure of Indigenous technologies or evaluation of them without regard
      to their goals, leading to a view the colonization and the colonizer's
      society is solely responsible for all (useful) technology.
    * The idea that technological development is inextricably linked with
      unrelated historical events, thereby allowing the argument that a
      beneficial technology like penicillin production 'justifies' completely
      unrelated atrocities.
    * The idea that technological 'progress' is unidirectional and universally
      beneficial, which justifies 'scientific' (often simply military)
      appropriation of resources and land.
    * The idea of absolutist and collective 'progress,' which refuses to even
      countenance the questions "Is the world better now than in the past?" and
      "For whom is the world better now?"

As already mentioned, some of these ideas are clearly incorrect when stated directly, such as the idea that colonization was not violent.
But they can still be powerful rhetorical tools when used indirectly (for example, when an elementary school class studies colonialism without mentioning violence, or simply while deemphasizing the prevalence of violence).
This indirect approach dovetails with procedural rhetorics, which by their nature tend to present concepts indirectly (e.g., truths of a fictional world that reveal themselves upon repeated interaction, but which are never clearly stated to the player).
The following sections describe a variety of ways in which Minceraft's mechanics and operational logics uphold some of these myths.
