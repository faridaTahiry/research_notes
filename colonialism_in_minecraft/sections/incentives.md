### Advancements and Incentives

Achievements are ways for game developers to reward and recognize players for an in-game accomplishment. Achievements can serve as extrinsic motivation by incentivizing certain actions. The values of the game developers show through achievements as they are a way to give players a sense of direction and guide them, especially through an open-world game like Minecraft.

Minecraft has different systems for achievements depending on the system and version of the game. Console systems use a system where achievements are earned independent of each other and can also have weights associated with them through xbox points earned or a playstation trophy type. The PC Java Edition uses a more complex system that guides the player in a more logical format through the use of categorized trees, or advancement tabs.

The five tabs are currently “Minecraft”, “Adventure”, “Nether”, “The End”, and “Husbandry” which represent five different broad goals of Minecraft: learning game basics, adventure, exploring the nether, ending the game, and animal interactions.

Both the “Adventure” and “Husbandry” tabs stand out due to the fact they aren’t related directly to a specific Minecraft dimension. There are three dimensions in Minecraft: The Overworld, The Nether, and The End. The “Minecraft” achievement tab is associated with the starting world, The Overworld, as it an introductary path to the basic mechanics with achievements such as creating a crafting table and acquiring armor. Within this tab, there are achievements for entering the Nether dimension and the End dimension, hence tabs for those dimensions for the basic mechanics associated with that dimension.

With the three of the achievement tabs’ role [making sense mechanically], the developers had a specific direction in mind when they choose the specific tabs of “Adventure” and “Husbandry.” The “adventure” tab [stands out] as it groups violent achievements such as “Monster Hunter” (Kill any Hostile monster) and exploration achievements such as “Adventuring Time” (Discover every Biome).

Using Merriam-Webster’s second definition of adventure, an adventure is an exciting or remarkable experience. With that definition in mind, it can be said that all advancements are considered to be exciting undertakings. [excitement = killing and exploration]

Taking a closer look into the different achievements in this tree, many of the achievements involve attacking hostile mobs. However, there are achievements specifically directed at villager-player interactions. As achievements reward certain in-game actions, they amplify the way certain mechanics help perpetuates colonialist myths.

On the surface, the “Hero of the Village” achievement may seem to be a positive thing, helping to defend a village from a raid. So is “Hired Help” with the description of summoning an Iron Golem to help defend a village. However, these achievements support the mechanic of the helpless or “uncivilized” people. Ultimately, the villagers benefit from our defense and therefore the myth that they will also benefit from our colonization.

Another colonialist myth achievements help amplify is the myth that intelligent beings are inherently evil. With achievements from shooting a crossbow to killing every single hostile monster, it can be seen that users are guided towards killing hostile beings and that can be seen as self-defense or pure joy.

The “Very Very Frightening” achievement’s in-game description reads to strike a villager with lightning. Now that’s just cruel. It supports the myth that villagers, or Indigenous people, are sub-human, a joke, with the parent achievement being named “A Throwaway Joke.” It dehumanizes the villagers and makes them a literally target, not just for the lightening trident the user must throw at them to unlock the achievement.

The “Husbandry” tab consists of player-world interactions. [idk what to say]
