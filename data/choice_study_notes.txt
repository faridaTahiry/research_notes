# Choice study setup

## Conditions

- expected_success: all options should seem positive and outcome should feel
  positive.
- unexpected_success: all options should seem negative but outcome should feel
  positive.
- expected_failure: all options should seen negative and outcome should feel
  negative.
- unexpected_failure: all options should seem positive but outcome should feel
  negative.
- obvious_success: one option should seem positive while other option should
  seem negative; the positive-seeming option has an outcome that should feel
  positive, and the negative-seeming options have outcomes that should feel
  negative.
- obvious_failure: one option should seem positive while other option should
  seem negative; the positive-seeming option has an outcome that should feel
  negative, while the negative-seeming options have outcomes that should feel
  positive.

Note: The decision.case field is either "main" or "alt." It only matters in the
"obvious" cases, where it's "main" if the participant chose the "obvious"
choice, and "alt" if they chose a different option. In the "obvious_success"
case, the "main" choice led to a (hopefully expected) success, and the others
to (expected) failures, while in the "obvious_failure" case, the "main" choice
led to unexpected failure and the other choices led to unexpected success.

## Questions

Below are the questions that were asked. These were answered as 5-point Likert
items (but the items don't combine to make a full Likert scale).

- About options:
    * opt.obvious: Considering just the options, there seems to be a clear best
      option at this choice.
    * opt.balanced: Ignoring outcomes, the options at this choice all seem
      about equally good (or bad).
    * opt.nobad: Ignoring outcomes, there are no options that seem bad at this
      choice.
    * opt.nogood: Ignoring outcomes, none of the options at this choice seem
      good.
    * opt.stakes: Considering just the options, the stakes for this choice seem
      low.
- About outcomes:
    * out.fair: Given the options available, the outcome I got is fair.
    * out.unfair: The outcome that I got is unfair, given the options available.
    * out.sense: The outcome that I got makes sense given the option that I
      selected.
    * out.broken: There might be a problem with this choice--the outcome I got
      does not make sense.
    * out.good: The outcome that I got is a good outcome.
    * out.bad: I got a bad outcome.
    * out.happy: I'm happy with the option that I chose.
    * out.regret: I wish I had chosen a different option.
    * out.expected: I pretty much expected the outcome that I got.
    * out.unexpected: The outcome that I got is completely unexpected.

## Hypotheses

There were more than 100 hypotheses in the original study, but here are a few
interesting ones:

- Simple hypotheses:
    * About options:
        * Participants will feel that the "obvious" cases are obvious (using
          opt.obvious and opt.balanced).
        * Participants will feel that the "obvious" and "expected success"
          cases have some good options, and that the "expected failure" case
          has no good options (using opt.nogood).
    * About outcomes:
        * Participants will feel that outcomes which were supposed to seem good
          are good (using both out.good and out.bad).
        * Participants will feel that outcomes which were supposed to seem bad
          are bad (using both out.good and out.bad).

- Complex hypotheses:
    * About outcomes:
        * Participants will feel that unexpected positive outcomes are more
          fair than unexpected negative outcomes (comparing out.fair and
          out.unfair between unexpected_failure and unexpected_success).
        * Participants will feel that unexpected failures are worse outcomes
          than expected failures (comparing out.good and out.bad between the
          unexpected_failure and expected_failure cases).
        * Participants will be less satisfied with the outcomes of their
          obvious choices that lead to unexpected failure than with the
          outcomes of their doomed choices that lead to expected failure.
          (comparing out.happy and out.regret between the obvious_failure(main)
          and expected_failure cases).
        * Participants will feel less satisfied with a choice that leads to an
          unexpected negative outcome when the options seem to favor the chosen
          option vs. when the options are all positive (comparing out.happy and
          out.regret between the unexpected_failure and obvious_failure(main)
          cases).
