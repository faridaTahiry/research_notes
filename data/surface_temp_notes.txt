The surface_temp.csv file contains data in the following format:

year, month (1=January), latitude (°), longitude (°), temperature anomaly (°C)


Temperature anomalies are blank when data is not available (question:
where/when?). The temperature anomalies are measured in degrees Centigrade
relative to a baseline.

Data is from January 2000 through December 2018.

Original source is the NOAA Global Temperatures dataset
