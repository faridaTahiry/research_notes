## Tutorials

* `vimtutor` - Just run this on the command line and it will open up VIM's
  built-in tutorial (which of course, is just a text file that contains
  instructions to edit itself).

* [Interactive Tutorial](https://www.openvim.com/) - Covers the basics and lets you try them out as you go.

* [Learn vim For the Last Time: A Tutorial and Primer](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/) - Much longer tutorial that's quite complicated but has a lot of good stuff if you're curious.

* [Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/) - Game version to learn the basic movement commands, but the full game costs $ and isn't worth it.
