# Excuses for Colonialism

[meetings](index.html)

2019-6-7

## Notes

- Topic: excuses for colonialism 
- Hannah:
   * "West is superior" / "right to colonize" / "moral obligation to colonize"
   * "We're not the only ones" / "It's natural"
   * "Goal was to help/support colonies"
   * Pro-colonialism article: "The Case for Colonialism" by Bruce Gilley
       - Utilitarian argument
   * Circular logic in Orientalism book: England knows about Egypt and that it
     doesn't have the ability to self-govern, so they can confirm that they
     should occupy Egypt, so they do, and then Egypt is not self-governing, so
     they must need to be colonized...
   * "Colonialism: Myths and Realities" article has notion of colonization
     being more complicated than "let's go exploit others.
   * Benefits of colonialism is a post-hoc justification, not a initial
     motivation.
   * "Everyone is doing it argument"
      - Serves to distract from who had the most impact
      - Conflation of different conflict processes
      - Even so, that doesn't make it right

- Christine:
   * Natural law -- how humans should behave morally
      - Therefore other cultures are breaking natural law and need to be
        corrected
   * Natural progression from worse to betters
      - Is this really true?
      - Unbundle different achievements
      - Specificity of progress (e.g. aliens in SF always end up at computers
        and spaceships)
      - Where have the costs materialized?

- Peter:
   * Made a hierarchy of different excuses

- Ohana
   * Property
       - Ownership (up-for-grabs if not owned?)
       - Objectively better for land to be "productive"
   * Progress
       - Inevitability
       - How do you define "better?"
   * Paternalism
   * Racism is key to colonialism.

- Key concepts:
    * Progress/inevitability/natural progression
        * "Level 99 Capitalist"
    * Racism
    * Space/land
        * Article on "Forager"?
    * Look for any contradictory arguments that might crop up as we go along?
    * Benefits outweigh the harm
        * Good for game contexts
        * This is common in games, but was it even true in real life?

- What games to look at?
    * Might be good to compare 2+ games/genres?
    * Targeting games that people don't even think critically about already?
    * What are we trying to do that's different from a popular article?
        * Added design contribution?
        * Added technical contribution?
            * Would need some kind of lit review
        * Deeper analysis? (at the code level?)
    * Start with aiming for a design contribution
    * We need to be careful not to borrow cultures that don't belong to us.
        * We don't want to make a simplistic critique of racism either.

- What mechanics are we interested in?
    * Exploration-based games?
        * Minecraft-like?
        * Minecraft has broad name-recognition
