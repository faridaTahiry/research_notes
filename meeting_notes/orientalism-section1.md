# Orientalism Section 1

[meetings](index.html)

2019-6-13

## Notes

- Big ideas:
    * Peter: Orientalism as more than an idea or set of ideas, but is also a
      power structure.
    * Christine: How Europeans reformulate things through what they know
    * Ohana: Orientalism has a different scope here than how we often think of
      it today (China/Japan-centric).
          * Said is citing a lot of literary theory and literary works.
    * Hannah: knowledge = power, more knowledge -> more ability to colonize.
      Also power creates the need for knowledge.
- Knowledge as simultaneously a useful tool but also prescriptive rather than
  descriptive (and ultimately inaccurate).
    * There's a whole 'nother knowledge = power happening here.
    * Some of it is knowledge as justification for use of power.
    * Another component is knowledge as means to motivate commoners not to
      resist conscription so that technical legal power can be actualized.
- Arbitrary categories -> polarization -> stuff
    * Division polarizes; polarization creates hostility
- "Domestication" of other cultures (familiarization in service of
  understanding) is common/okay/universal?
    * Maybe we don't 100% agree with this?
- What's the relationship between overgeneralization and mythologization?
    * Us/them distinction inevitably leads to overgeneralization.
    * Overgeneralization goes hand-in-hand with us/them thinking.
    * Dehumanization is part of this too.
- Ignoring the modern Orient is a really important point.
- Why is Egypt so prominent in our history books?
    * How important exactly was Napoleon's invasion?
    * Contemporary history isn't there, only a particular romanticizeable
      period.
    * Also true of other colonies.
- Is the idea of capturing culture/people through textual/scholarly
  descriptions inherently flawed?
    * But is all communication futile?
    * Even reading this book is participating in Orientalism.
    * Communicated knowledge is inferior to direct experience.
    * Are scientific experiments a portable/universal version of direct
      experience (and an equivalent might not exist for e.g., sociology).
    * High school chemistry labs are a great example of the text being elevated
      above the experience.
    * If a culture isn't representative of a study you've read about, then you
      assume that the culture is behaving unnaturally.
- Us/them division also works to pacify the not-actually-rich "us" by dividing
  them from the "them."
    * Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States"
    * Colonization is highly dependent on patriotism. 
        - This comes back to the knowledge is power.
        - Goes beyond patriotism to Eurocentrism.
- Defining knowledge not as "things that are true" but as "beliefs that are
  held" clarifies things.
- Call of Duty etc.
    * Violence is okay against the right people.
- Games broadly
    * Games literally objectify the other.
    * PC is always the only human (except in multi-player).
    * Games fit right in with the rest of Orientalism.
    * Games unlike more static media can portray action/consequence ideas.
- Islam being demonized because it didn't fit the image of the Oriental as
  vulnerable/passive.
    * Orientalism mostly happened after Islamic invasion of Europe.
    * Christianity as a unifying cultural element to control reactions to an
      Islamic invasion.
    * Construction of "Europe" happened in part through Christianity.
    * Christianity becomes a common thread that allows us/them distinctions of
      today to be echoed into the past.
- Identity in modern media is very closely linked to nations and geography.
    * These identities are very shallow compared to e.g. tribal identities.
- Identity-based justifications of invasions are ...interesting.
- Games and religion?
- There is some respect in Orientalism at least for some of the "great works"
  in the past of e.g., Egypt.
    * What's the reason that no such respect exists for natives in North
      America or in Australia?
          - Greeks weren't there?
              * But what about India?
          - Taking over existing institutions vs. genocide?
              * But what about South America?
          - No ability to exile respected objects into the distant past?
          - People vs. land as resource?

## Plans

- Keep reading Orientalism?
    * Read something from a Native American perspective or at least a
      perspective that's left out of Orientalism? 
    * Something like this but from a Native perspective?
    * Mechanics of elimination/resource extraction seem more relevant to the
      North American genocide than to other colonial projects.
    * Keep reading for now; if we do find another source but it's a whole book
      maybe switch gears.

- Focus on Minecraft?
    * Minecraft generalizes well
    * Operational-logic level analysis of how it implements colonialism.
    * Comparisons to other games that use the same logics.
    * Alternate design ideas.
        * Influence from the start instead of trying to patch from the end.

- Methodology
    1. Detailed analysis of how the game implements/expresses ideas, and what
       those ideas are.
    2. Brainstorm using inversions of those ideas.
    3. Polish those into design ideas.

- Read critical play/critical design methodology?

## TODO

- Get into analysis next week
- Find another reading (by tomorrow?)
- Keep reading Orientalism
