# Orientalism Section 2

[meetings](index.html)

2019-7-8

## Notes

- Impersonality of Illagers & Villagers connects to page 149/150 of Orientalism.
- Projecting past onto present instead of looking at what actually exists now.
- Valorization of first = better plus we're further progressed and therefore
  better.
- Extreme objective distance vs. extreme personal/subjective analysis: neither
  actually sees the thing itself.
- The STEM/Humanities competition happening hundreds of years ago.
- Science is very one-size-fits-all but even though that works well for some
  natural phenomenon it doesn't work nearly as well for sociological issues.
    * E.g. startup culture "let's apply Science to it."
    * Narrow sociological studies.
- Theme: making the results be what you want them to.
    * If you can make something Scientific, it gains validity.
- Relevant to games as there is an underlying equation because you programmed
  it.
    * So what you decide to program implies a worldview.
- Is there psych literature on games implanting unconscious bias.
- How do relationships work in Stardew Valley?
    * Are they just inherited from Harvest Moon?
    * Did the designer really believe in reciprocity & gifts?
    * Was it a conscious or unconscious decision?
    * To meet a budget?
- The way games are isn't just a progress, it's also revising and erasing.
- Games are often more constructed than other media.
    * You can't represent everything, so you have to decide what's important
      (to you).
    * What can you make in Minecraft is a statement.
    * Achievements define goals in dialogue with players.
    * Also what gets you XP?
- How is territory defined and contested?
- Ridiculousness of sending a servant to mark up the pyramids.
- Chains of citations from us that go back to e.g. Renan.
- How is Minecraft useful to Imperialism/Colonialism today?
- The existence of aggressive mobs conditions the player's behavior.
    * E.g. to develop tech to build beds, or build fortifications.
    * Idea of self-defense.

- Apparently our rare books collection has pages from Napoleon's original
  Description of Egypt...

## Plans

- For tomorrow: list of mechanics in Minecraft (can be some dynamics too).
    * From there: each have a mini-writeup of one particular mechanic/dynamic.

## TODO

- Look for psych research on implanting unconscious bias via games.
- Look in-depth at Minecraft achievements.
